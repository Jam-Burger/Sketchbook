# Elementary Cellular Automata

## Introduction

This project explores the fascinating world of [Elementary Cellular Automata](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html). ECA is a type of [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) with a simple set of rules governing the evolution of cells on a grid. The state of each cell is determined by its current state and the states of its neighboring cells, according to a set of predefined rules.

## Rule Numbering

The rules are numbered from 0 to 255, based on the Wolfram numbering system. Rule 0 represents the simplest rule, where all cells remain in the "off" state, while rule 255 represents the most complex rule, where all cells transition to the "on" state.

## Rule Outputs

The output of each rule is a visual representation of the evolution of the cellular automaton over time. Each row in the output corresponds to a generation, and each cell in a row represents the state of a cell in the automaton at that generation. This repository, within the ["all rules"](./all%20rules) folder, showcases the visual output for each of the 256 rules.
