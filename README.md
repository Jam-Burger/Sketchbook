# Sketchbook

Welcome to my Sketchbook repository! This repository serves as a showcase for my generative art and simulation projects.

## Technologies Used

Most of the major projects in this repository are created using [Processing](https://processing.org/), a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. However, there might be some projects that utilize [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), a JavaScript library with a similar purpose. Regardless of the tool used, the essence of the projects remains the same.

Feel free to explore the projects and get inspired by the world of generative art and simulations!

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've already made, plus some cool ideas I'll be working on next:

- Fractal Trees: A visualization of fractal tree structures using recursion.
- Cellular Automata: Simulations based on cellular automata principles, such as Conway's Game of Life.
- Particle Systems: Dynamic systems of particles influenced by various forces, creating mesmerizing patterns.
- Generative Art: Abstract artworks generated using mathematical algorithms and randomness.
- Simulation of Natural Phenomena: Simulations of natural phenomena like fluid dynamics, flocking behavior, and more.

## Running the Projects

### 1. Processing

- Download and install Processing from the [official website](https://processing.org/).
- Open each project file (.pde) within the Processing development environment.
- Press "Run" (or use the keyboard shortcut) to execute the code and view the visuals.

### 2. p5.js

For projects using p5.js, you have two options:

- Open the project's HTML file directly in your web browser. This will launch the simulation or artwork within the browser window.
- Alternatively, you can set up a local development server to run the HTML file. This can be achieved using tools like Live Server or Python's http-server.

## Acknowledgments

- The [Processing Foundation](https://processingfoundation.org/) for creating [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), these open-source libraries provide a fantastic foundation for creative coding exploration. Their ease of use and extensive capabilities have been instrumental in bringing these projects to life.
- In particular, I'd like to acknowledge [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman), whose work (especially the ["Nature of Code"](https://natureofcode.com/) book and ["The Coding Train"](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) YouTube channel) has been a significant source of learning and inspiration for many creative coders, myself included.

## Contributing

While I don't expect contributions to this repository, they are always welcome! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or improvements, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request. Additionally, if you've created your own generative art or simulations inspired by this repository, I'd love to see them!
